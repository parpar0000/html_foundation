            <h3>What is a Framework in Programming? And Why You Should Use One?</h3>

            <p>
                <em>A framework is a set of programming tools to build well-structured, reliable software and systems. Let’s explore what a framework in programming is, understand why a framework is necessary, and look at the various framework examples.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Coding can be challenging, even for those with an IT background. Development must go through various tasks, debugging frustrations, and trial and error. Many successful teams prefer using frameworks to reduce development time. These frameworks feature libraries of APIs, software modeling, and bundled code to make programming easier. Let’s explore what programming frameworks are, why they matter, and what features should a programming framework ideally include:
            </p>

            <h3>What is a Framework in Programming?</h3>

            <p>
                The dictionary definition of the framework as a “basic structure underlying a system” is not far different from what a framework is in programming. Whether the system is a house, a car, a theory, or a mobile app, the concept of the framework is the same: it provides the support and essential ‘guide’ of the structure being built.
            </p>

            <p>
                A framework in programming is a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized to speed up development. A framework may include a library but is defined by the principle of inversion of control (IoC). With traditional programming, the custom code calls into the library to access reusable code. With IoC, the framework calls on custom pieces of code when necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                A framework can include support programs, compilers, code libraries, toolsets, and APIs to develop software and create systems. Open-source frameworks are constantly being updated and improved.

            <h3>Why are Frameworks Used in Software Development?</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of a framework is to assist in the development, providing standard, low-level functionality so that developers can focus efforts on the elements that make the project unique.
            </p>

            <p>
                High-quality, pre-vetted functionality increases software reliability, speeds up programming time, and simplifies testing. With an active base of users and ongoing code improvements, frameworks help improve security and offer a base of support. Ultimately, frameworks are used to save time and money.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the Features of a Good Framework?</h3>

            <p>
                There are many kinds of frameworks, with some more popular than others. Developers often choose frameworks they are most familiar with, but that framework may not be the right for the job. Instead, consider the following features of good frameworks when deciding on the proper framework for the project at hand:
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Functionality: Choose a framework that provides the functionality needed for the project at hand, respecting that each framework has its limits and not investing in a framework that does far more than your project will ever need.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Consistency: A framework that can assist in consistency for large or distributed teams
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Documentation: Choose a framework that has well-documented code and provides implementation training
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Active Community: Frameworks are only as robust as the user base of support. Choose a framework that is well-established with an active user base.
                    </li>

                </ul>

            <h3>Challenges of Using a Software Framework</h3>
            <p>
                Software frameworks can become a costly crutch if developers are not strong in the language the framework is based upon or if the developer over-relies on the framework instead of custom code. This problem can lead to software bloat and performance issues.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                There are risks in choosing a framework that is too new or unsupported, which could require costly re-tooling if the framework becomes obsolete. Similarly, if the framework has poorly understood limitations, this could impact the project.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Programming Frameworks</h3>

            <p>
                There are various programming frameworks, each built upon a programming language and specializing in its function, whether working on a web app, database, or mobile app. This section will include various programming frameworks, popular frameworks for each type, and everyday examples.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Web Frameworks</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Web application frameworks (WAF), or web frameworks (WF), support the development of web applications with web services, web resources, and web APIs. There are different web frameworks for both the front end (how the web app looks) and the back end (how it works).
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Angular</strong></li>
                    <p>
                        What is Angular? Angular is an open-source web application framework based on TypeScript and maintained by the Angular Team at Google. Angular features a large ecosystem of tools and solutions from a broad user base. Angular is ideally suited for highly customized and progressive web apps (PWAs).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        AngularJS refers to all 1.X versions of the framework that previously were JavaScript-based, with Angular being a complete rewrite using TypeScript for all versions 2 and up. Over 1.4 million live websites are using Angular.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Angular Framework Examples: PayPal, Upwork, Google, Nike
                    </p>
                        
                    <li><strong>Vue JS</strong></li>

                    <p>
                        What is Vue JS? Vue JS (Vue.js) is a JavaScript-based progressive framework that offers greater flexibility around using HTML and CSS and the model-view-view model (MVVM) architecture. Vue is easy to learn and has a vast community of support.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Vue JS Framework Examples: Trustpilot, Nintendo, Behance
                    </p>
                        
                </ul>

                <li><strong>Mobile App Frameworks</strong></li>

                <p>
                    A mobile development framework (mobile app development framework) supports the development of mobile applications for a specific environment, classified as native (platform-specific), hybrid (native back-end shell with web app front-end), or cross-platform (shared codebase for all). There are many mobile app development frameworks not covered here, including, among many, Swiftic, Native Scripts, and Ionic.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>React Native</strong></li>

                    <p>
                        What is React Native? React Native is an open-source JavaScript UI framework created by Facebook to develop Android and iOS applications. It targets mobile platforms instead of the browser.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        React Native Framework Examples: Facebook, Skype, Shopify, and NFL use ReactNative for their Android and iOS applications.
                    </p>

                    <li><strong>Flutter</strong></li>

                    <p>
                        What is Flutter? Flutter is Google’s open-source mobile UI framework for creating cross-platform applications and, most recently, with Flutter 2, web, and desktop (native) apps. Flutter is based upon Dart and is considered a modern framework, being simple to use and leveraging hot reload to see results in real-time.
                    </p>
                    Flutter Framework Examples: Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, eBay, Google ads
                    <p>
                </ul>
